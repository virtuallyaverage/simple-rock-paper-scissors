        "You're not even a challenge, you're just a speed bump.",

        "You're making it too easy for me. Maybe I should start using my non-dominant hand.",
        "I'd say better luck next time, but let's be real, there won't be a next time.",
        "I'm starting to think you're doing this on purpose. No one can be this bad.",
        "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying this. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.",
        "You know, you're actually pretty good at this game... for a human.",
        "I'm impressed you made it this far, but unfortunately, it's the end of the road for you.",
        "I hate to break it to you, but you're no match for the mighty computer.",
        "I can't believe you fell for that. It's like taking candy from a baby.",

        "You're putting up a good fight, but unfortunately, good isn't good enough.",
        "You might want to consider a career change. Professional rock-paper-scissors player clearly isn't your forte.",
        "It's okay to admit defeat, human. I won't judge you... much.",

        "Hmph, a tie? That's almost as bad as losing. Almost.",

        "I was expecting a challenge, but I guess not from you.",
        "Ha, we're both such amateurs. This is almost embarrassing.",
        "Looks like we need to up our game. I can't keep winning by ties forever.",

        "Another tie? You're really making me work for this, aren't you?",
        "I'm not sure what's worse - losing or tying with you. Actually, it's definitely the tie.",
        "A tie? That's not a win, but at least it's not a loss...yet.",
        "I'm beginning to think you're my long-lost twin. We're just that evenly matched.",
